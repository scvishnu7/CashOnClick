CashOnClick
===========

One app i have created to play with <a href="www.cashonad.com">CashOnAd</a>.
It actually modifies the sqlite database and preferences file of the target application. 
Doing so makes the app think that the reward points are real.


-> This app is just for historical and educational purpose.

CashOnAdd have gone so far that now they have made the app strong by encrypting the preferences and database, hence
this nasty trick work no-longer.
